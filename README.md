# outputs to STDOUT

```

#### options:

- `--format`: `js|json` the output format. Defaults to `js`.

```
importer = require('j2c-importer')
obj = importer.toJ2c('a {background-color: red;}', {case:'camel'})
// {' a': {backgroundColor: 'red'}}

js = importer.toJS('a {background-color: red;}', {case:'snake', indent: '  '})
// a multi-line, indented version of "{' a': {background_color: 'red'}}"

JSON = importer.toJSON('a {background-color: red;}', {case:'dash', indent: '\t'})
// a multi-line, indented version of "{\" a\": {\"background-color\": \"red\"}}"
```

### Limitations:

- Comments are dropped
- Some CSS hacks may end up mangled. Check twice (or thrice).
